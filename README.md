AIM OF THE PROJECT :
> To predict if a breast cancer is Malignant or Benign using Numerical Dataset.

Breast Cancer is one of the most common type of cancer in women. When cancers are found early, they can often be cured. 
I have taken the dataset of previous breast cancer patients and trained the model to predict whether the cancer is Benign or Malignant.

Steps:
1. Import required libraries
2. Download Dataset and import the data
3. Load & Explore the Dataset
4. Perform LabelEncoding
5. Split the data into Independent and Dependent sets and perform Feature Scaling
6. Building Logistic Regression Classifier
7. Evaluate performance of the model
